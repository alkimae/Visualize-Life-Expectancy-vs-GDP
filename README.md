Visualizing Life Expectancy vs GDP Across Six Countries

This project aims to explore the relationship between a country's economic output and the life expectancy of its citizens. The investigation involves data preparation, analysis using visualizations, and an interpretation of the study's findings.

# Key Questions
To achieve these goals, I will address the following questions:

# Temporal Trends:

Has life expectancy shown a consistent increase over time in the six nations?
Has the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) exhibited a steady rise over time in these nations?

# Correlation Analysis:

Is there a discernible correlation between a country's GDP and its life expectancy?

# Descriptive Statistics:

What is the average life expectancy across the selected nations?
How is life expectancy distributed within these countries?

# Data Sources
To carry out this investigation, I rely on the following data sources:

# GDP Data:
World Bank national accounts data
OECD National Accounts data files

# Life Expectancy Data:
World Health Organization
